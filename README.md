<p>Paternity testing determines whether a guy is the biological father of a kid. Paternity is established by matching the child&#39;s DNA to the purported father&#39;s profile.</p>

<h2><strong>You&#39;re not the father, according to a paternity test. So, what&#39;s next?</strong></h2>

<p>It&#39;s a prevalent scenario: As any good parent, you begin raising a child and get emotionally connected. Then you come across text messages or other red flags that appear to show your boyfriend cheated on you during the pregnancy. You take a <strong><a href="https://www.choicedna.com/dna-testing-location/abilene-tx/">DNA test clinic Abilene TX</a></strong>, revealing the information you were trying to avoid. You&#39;re not the father, according to a paternity test. So, what&#39;s next?</p>

<h3><strong>If you and your partner have never married,</strong></h3>

<h4><strong>When the kid was never formally claimed by you</strong></h4>

<p>There are choices if you and your spouse were never married and didn&#39;t sign a Voluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity form or birth certificate before <strong><a href="https://www.choicedna.com/dna-testing-location/abilene-tx/">24 hour DNA testing Abilene TX</a></strong> but you still want to keep your relationship with the kid.</p>

<p>The court will decide whether you have a case, and you, the mother, and the biological father (if he has been found by legal DNA testing) will all be interviewed extensively.</p>

<p>There are some&nbsp;guidelines&nbsp;that you should be aware of before going to</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">You must be a legal adult</li>
	<li aria-level="1">You must have time to care for the kid</li>
	<li aria-level="1">You must be able to pay to raise the child</li>
	<li aria-level="1">You must be physically able to perform the tasks of a legal guardian</li>
	<li aria-level="1">You must demonstrate that you would be a positive influence and role model for the child.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the process is completed and they believe you have met all their requirements, they may decide you are qualified to be a legal guardian and continue your relationship with the child, assuming the biological parent consents. If the parents refuse to consent, you may still be able to become the legal guardian of the kid if the parents are considered unsuitable for raising the child.</p>

<h4><strong>When you legally claimed the child,</strong></h4>

<p>Even if a paternity test proves you are not the biological father, if you never married the mother but signed the Voluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity or birth certificate, the court is unlikely to &quot;let you off the hook&quot; for child support or agree you should be reimbursed for any child support paid.</p>

<p>Some states enable fathers to disestablish paternity so that they are no longer financially liable for support, although the requirements are stringent, and repayment for child support is seldom included. To find out what your state permits, speak with a family law attorney.</p>

<h4><strong>If You Are (Or Have Been) Married to Your Companion</strong></h4>

<p>In almost all circumstances, if the kid was born during your marriage to the mother, you are automatically regarded as the child&#39;s biological father and legal guardian.</p>

<p>The emotional agony of learning that the kid you believed was biologically yours isn&#39;t can be agonizing, and you may be confused about your connection with them. There are occasions when it doesn&#39;t matter when it comes to DNA.</p>

<h3><strong>When You Aren&#39;t the Father, What Does A DNA Test Say?</strong></h3>

<p>Many people who do a paternity test are puzzled by what they read when receiving their DNA test results. The conclusion of your test results can often be found at the top and bottom of your test result page. Today, we&#39;ll go through the terms that a supposed father isn&#39;t the biological father. Here&#39;s a quick rundown of what to expect from the conclusion section of your paternity test results.</p>

<p>The non-observed alleles at the loci in question led to this result (x). The putative father is missing genetic markers that should have been passed down to the biological father&#39;s kid. The likelihood of paternity is &quot;zero percent.&quot;</p>

<p>Please remember that the conclusion section of your findings will vary with the type of DNA test, but they will resemble the description above.</p>

<h4><strong>Putting It All Together</strong></h4>

<p>The easiest way to avoid this traumatic experience&mdash;especially if you and the child&#39;s mother are not married&mdash;is to be proactive in confirming paternity before signing any recognition of paternity or birth certificate.</p>

<p>The procedure becomes considerably tougher after those two years. Men may avoid legally binding agreements and heartbreaking relationships by insisting on a legal paternity test after the baby or a <strong><a href="https://www.choicedna.com/dna-testing-location/abilene-tx/">Legal paternity test Abilene TX</a></strong> before the kid is born.</p>
